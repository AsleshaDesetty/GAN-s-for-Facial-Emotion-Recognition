Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication that plays a vital role in analyzing a person’s attitude and mental state. From the past two decades, much research has been done in the area of recognizing human emotions using a class of various machine learning techniques. The major limitation in the machine learning technique is the presence of unbalanced data to train the model. This problem can be addressed using from fake images. In this project, we will propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which is used to train deeper neural networks using a lot of machine-generated data to distinguish real images) with Particle Swam Optimization (GAN – PSO) algorithm to accurately identify the different types of facial emotions. Experimentation will be performed with the FER2013 faces expression dataset which consists of seven different labels namely surprise, disgust, happy, neutral, fear, sad and anger. Experimental results are expected to propose that the GAN-PSO algorithm achieves better performance (in terms of accuracy, true positive ratio (recall), precision, F-measure and G-measure) when compared to the existing algorithms for facial emotion detection.



**MODEL WORKING**

Generative Model:
• It recognizes patterns from the input variables to generate an output that is unknown and based only on training data.
• Generative models are able to generate new examples from the sample that are not only similar to the examples but are indistinguishable as well.
• Ex : Naïve Bayes classifier is most commonly used as discriminative model.

**GAN:**

• GAN’s are a Deep Learning based Generative Model that is used for unsupervised learning. It is basically a system, where two competing Neural Networks compete with each other to create or generate variations in data.
• GAN’s architecture consists of two models
      1)Generator Model          
      2)Discriminator Model
